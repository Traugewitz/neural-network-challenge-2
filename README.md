# neural-network-challenge-2
Module 19 Challenge
This module creates a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.

I started by importing our dependencies and reading in our dataset.

We reviewed our dataset and created our target values of Attrition and Department.
We scaled our X data and encoded applicable columns.

I then created, compiled, and trained my model.
